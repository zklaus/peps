Abstract
========

This PEP proposes new environment markers for package dependencies.
:pep:`508` introduced environment markers to specify dependencies based on the Python implementation and version.
This PEP extends the environment markers to allow specifying dependencies based on the threading model of the Python interpreter.



Motivation
==========

:pep:`508` established environment markers to specify dependencies based on environment conditions.
However, it does not provide a way to specify dependencies based on the threading model of the Python interpreter.
This PEP proposes to extend the environment markers to allow specifying dependencies based on the threading model of the Python interpreter.
